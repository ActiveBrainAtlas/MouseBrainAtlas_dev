- [x] Assign weights to samples. All samples inside a landmark should have high weights. Use all samples outside landmark as negative, but sample weights reduce by the distance to landmark center.
- [x] More detailed confusion matrix.
- [ ] Investigate false positives around a landmark.
- [ ] Derive a result quality measure - score peakedness, etc.
- [ ] inspired by active appearance model, can we learn to optimize contours based on the texture descriptor directly? instead of depending on score maps.
- [ ] Implement some sort of assistance in GUI to save user time in reviewing boundaries. e.g. click a few boundary points, automatically estimate best boundaries (specify transform or linear control-point based shape model). This is more convenient than Clicking each vertices to create new contours.
- [ ] Deal with brightness inhomogeneity. Option 1: Augment training examples with artificially added brightness. Option 2: Normalize image histograms (use histogram matching algorithm).
