## The setup

The scripts are intended to run on a virtual environement for ease of use. This makes it so you do not need to worry about installing each package. For developers on the Atlas machine, this is not necessary.

A description of the environment variables are given in the [Environment Variables](environmentVariables.md) document.

## The scripts

There are 4 scripts that encapsulate the entire pipeline, they are listed below:
- Preprocessing [unfinished]
- [Compute Patch Features](demo_compute_patch_features.md)
- [Generate Probability Volumes](demo_generate_probability_volumes.md)
- [Registration](demo_registration.md)
