# Installation

This part needs to be done only once. It has already been done on the atlas room workstation. No need to do it for regular uses.

```
ï¼ƒ Install vtk 7.1.1 (Cannot use newest version 8 because the window crashes immediately after it launches)
cd /home/yuncong/MouseBrainAtlas/setup/
wget https://www.vtk.org/files/release/7.1/vtkpython-7.1.1-Linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar xfz vtkpython-7.1.1-Linux-64bit.tar.gz

# Install required python packages
sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev
pip install cython==0.28.5 # see this issue https://github.com/h5py/h5py/issues/535
pip install git+https://github.com/pmneila/PyMCubes.git@9fd6059
```

# Regular use

First log into Ubuntu or switch account to yuncong (use the upper-right corner gear icon).

```
cd /home/yuncong/MouseBrainAtlas
source setup/config.sh

cd setup
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:`pwd`/vtkpython-7.1.1-Linux-64bit/lib/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`/vtkpython-7.1.1-Linux-64bit/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

cd ../demo/
python download_demo_data_render3d.py (Not necessary since all data are already downloaded)
python demo_render3d.py --render_config_atlas render_config_atlas.csv --experiments_config demo/lauren_experiments.csv 
```

- The file `lauren_experiments.csv` specifies which experiments to display markers for and the color of each.
- The file `render_config_atlas.csv` specifies the color/opacity of each atlas structure.
- If want to show SNR_L with the largest possible probability level, in `demo_render3d.py` set `use_big_snr_l` to True.
- In the 3D viewer, use mouse wheel to zoom and SHIFT+drag to move. Press Q to quit.

If encounter the error "X Error of failed request", follow [this fix](https://askubuntu.com/a/882047).
