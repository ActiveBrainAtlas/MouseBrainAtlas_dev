## Alignment file naming schema

Alignments are always with respect to a certain brain. Alignment files always contain the keywords `_wrt_<BRAIN_TYPE>` to indicate this. There are 4 major "brain types" that I list below.
  - canonicalAtlasSpace
  - wholebrain
  - wholebrainXYcropped
  - fixedWholebrain
