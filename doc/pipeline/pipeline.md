Note: Script names may change when the code is officially released. The current names are iterative using the order the scripts are meant to be run. The prepended 'a_script_preprocess` is simply to organize the scripts together while in development.


# Preprocessing Scripts

The single setup script and seven preprocessing scripts are spaced with user intervention steps such that the first script is run, the user is required to perform some step by hand, then the second script is run, etc...
