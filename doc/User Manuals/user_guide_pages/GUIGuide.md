# Creating annotations using the graphical interface

There are two ways to place annotation on images.

## Method 1: Draw contours on images and reconstruct 3-D structure from contours.

For complete instructions on how to interact with GUI, see [User Interface README](gui/README.md).

### Saving 2-D contours

Click "Save contours". All contours currently loaded are saved into `ANNOTATION_DIR/<stack>/<stack>_annotation_contours_<timestamp>.hdf`.

### Saving 3-D structures

3-D structures are saved at `<stack>_annotation_structuresHanddrawn_<timestamp>.hdf`

Also see [explanation of annotation file](DataDescription.md#annotation)

## Method 2: Manual adjustment of pre-built atlas structures.
