# Master File List

This document is meant to contain an exhaustive list of every file generated throughout the pipeline, what it contains, and how to use it. It is still in development and will take another week or two to finish.

## 1) Preprocessing Stage

#### CSHL_data_processed/
Contains ALL preprocessing data from the inputs `SLICE_lossless.jp2` to the final outputs `SLICE_prep2_raw_NtbNormalizedAdaptiveInvertedGamma.tif`



## 2) Patch Features Stage



## 3) Probability Volume Stage



## 4) Registration/Visualization Stage



## 5) Atlas Bulding Stage
