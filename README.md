The Active Mouse Brain Atlas project provides a toolkit for automatic registration of histological series to a standardized brain atlas, based on detecting structures by high-resolution textures. For details refer to the [user guide](doc).

# Installation

This system has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04. The feature extraction step can be significantly accelerated using GPU (80 seconds per image using a single Nvidia Titan X, 15 seconds using 8 GPUs, compared to 30 minutes using CPU).

```
git clone https://github.com/ActiveBrainAtlas/MouseBrainAtlas.git
cd setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Cloning the repository takes about 3 minutes using a 20MB/s connection. Installing requirements takes around 5 minutes.

# Demo

We provide demo scripts that demonstrate the process of registering an example brain with the atlas, and visualizing the result. See the [demo](demo) directory for details. The demo takes roughly half an hour from start to finish.
