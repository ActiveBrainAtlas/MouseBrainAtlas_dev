## Demo of MouseBrainAtlas registration

The following has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and might not work on other operating systems.

This demo assumes a subject brain (DEMO999) is roughly globally aligned with the atlas (atlasV7).
It shows how one can:
- register 12N (hypoglossal nucleus) individually.
- register 3N_R (occulomotor, right) and 4N_R (trochlear, right) as a group.
- visualize the aligned atlas overlaid on original images

---------------------------

## Install packages, setup environment variables and download input data
```
sudo apt-get install wget python-pip python-tk
cd setup
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
source set_env_variables.sh
cd ../demo
./download_demo_data.py
```
  * Pulling the Git repo takes 3-4 minutes with good Internet connection.
  * Running `./download_demo_data.py` takes less than 1 minute.

The input data are downloaded under `demo/demo_data/`.

## Register 12N individually
- `$ ./register_brains_demo_12N.py`
  - Expected runtime of about 8 minutes
  - Output displays 1000 iterations of gradient descent

## Register 3N_R and 4N_R as a group
- `$ ./register_brains_demo_3N_R_4N_R.py`
  - Expected runtime of about 3 minutes
  - Output displays 1000 iterations of gradient descent

The outputs are also generated in `demo_data/` folder. The outputs include the transform parameters and transformed atlas structures.

------------------------

## Visualize registration results

To visualize the multi-probability level structures of the aligned atlas overlaid on original images:
- `$ ./visualize_registration_demo_3_structures.py`
  - Expected runtime of about 1 minute
  - "Image fails to load. Trying to convert from other resol/versions" is part of expected output

An [example output image](example_atlas_overlay.jpg) is included in this repo.
The background image is the intensity-normalized Neurotrace Blue-stained section.
White contours are the atlas after simple global registration.
Colored contours are the atlas after local registration. Different colors correspond to different probability levels. The  levels from outside in are 0.99, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.01.

The complete set of overlay images are under `CSHL_registration_visualization/DEMO999_atlas_aligned_multilevel_down16_all_structures/NtbNormalizedAdaptiveInvertedGammaJpeg/`. Note: They are 16X downsampled to allow for easy downloading and visualization.


Input and expected output will be downloaded from an open S3 bucket
